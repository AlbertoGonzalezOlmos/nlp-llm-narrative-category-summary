# Narrative analysis through LLM-based computation

Exploration of prompts to categorize and summarize disperse narratives in short pieces of text.

### Background information

Compared to other democratic countries, I believe Denmark can be proud of the colorfulness of options, level of societal trust in the government and how Denmark broadly keeps up with the good work.

While living here, it was mind shifting to learn that a good number of the population is not set in electing any particular color (although there may be a range of colors they are likely to choose from). Indeed, it is common practice to use a website like this [political quiz](https://danmark.isidewith.com/en/political-quiz) (for English speaking) to help one decide which political party to vote.

Among all the turmoil generated by popularizing the use of Natural Language Processing tools to increase productivity (or enterntainment), it is interesting to realize that, for first time, we may be able to implement a near real time democratic system. With the available tools, it is possible to conduct qualitative research in a radically nuanced and pervasive way compared to what researchers such as Daniel Kahneman did with the traditional post, pen and paper. I don't mean pervasive unconsented mining of personal information, that is already being done for a while now. What I mean is that for first time we, as society, have tools to ask the opinion of nearly everyone in a country, and synthesize such rich information to make political decisions or, why not, to find increasingly better `local maxima` in the optimization process of [social algorithms](https://matteopasquinelli.com/3000-years-of-algorithmic-rituals/) (as Matteo Pasquinelli beautifully describes). I find very exciting that soon, governments will start educating their populations in the use of [swarm AI](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2311/2311.00728.pdf) tools to leverage the power of democracy again since it was conceived.

This work-in-progress project is my proof of concept platonic attempt to contribute to a better future for humanity.

When I took this photo, my mind started to change.
