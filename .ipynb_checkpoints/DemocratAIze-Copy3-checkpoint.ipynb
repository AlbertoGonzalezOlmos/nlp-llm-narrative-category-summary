      " user 3: The Danish schools have grown progressively worse over recent years due to underfunding. We need more teachers and resources. ; \n",
      " user 4: While some schools in Denmark are very poor others are doing well, it depends on the neighborhood and local population.; \n",

      " user 9: I thinkthe teachers are badly paid and educated and the minister should do something about it.; \n",
      " user 10: Children need to follow a very strict curriculum and there is little room for flexibility and I think children learn better when the teacher knows which is their level in each subject.; \n",
