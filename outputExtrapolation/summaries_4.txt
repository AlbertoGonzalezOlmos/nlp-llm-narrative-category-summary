"The opinions of the users can be summarized as follows:\n\n-The Danish education system is good in that it teaches children to work together and to resolve conflicts, but some teaching methods are outdated.\n-The Danish schools have grown progressively worse over recent years due to underfunding. We need more teachers and resources.\n-While some schools in Denmark are very poor, others are doing well. It depends on the neighborhood and local population.\n-The education system here is wonderful. Children are given a lot of freedom, and they have space to develop themselves creatively while also being supported to learn the foundations needed to a successful life.\n-I think the schools are well equipped but my son doesn't like being in front of a book the whole day.\n-Teachers and directors in the school have changed in the past years and I think that more stability in the school would benefit the education of the children.\n-I think the teachers feel demotivated and something should be done so that they feel better at work.\n-I think the teachers are badly paid and educated and the minister should do something about it.\n-Children need to follow a very strict curriculum and there is little room for flexibility and I think children learn better when the teacher knows which is their level in each subject."
